This code defines a class Solution with a public method maxProduct that takes a vector of integers nums as input and returns the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.
It initializes variables maxProductForward and maxProductBackward to store the maximum products encountered while traversing the array from left to right and right to left respectively.
It also initializes variables productForward and productBackward to store the current product while traversing the array from left to right and right to left respectively.
It traverses the array twice, once from left to right and once from right to left, updating the current product and maximum product encountered so far in each direction.
It resets the current product to 1 whenever encountering a 0, as multiplying by 0 will always result in 0.
Finally, it returns the maximum of maxProductForward and maxProductBackward as the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.
